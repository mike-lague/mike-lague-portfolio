    <h1>Introduction</h1>    
  <p>I'm a software engineer with more than thirty years of experience, seeking new opportunities in development, teaching, or testing. I'm also an avid actor and singer in community theatre, in plays, musicals, and light opera.</p>
  <p>What matters to me is creating strong, vital connections with people: whether they be friends, family, colleagues, students, or an audience.</p>
